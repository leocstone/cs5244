## Final Project for Web Application Development
This project implements a complete web application, including a frontend written with Vue.js and a backend written in Java using Jersey.

The frontend queries the backend server, which queries a SQL server for the details of the books listed on the website.

The client can add books to their cart, and POST an order to the backend, where it will be stored in the SQL database.

The contents of the client's cart are stored as a cookie, so it is saved across browser sessions.
